Beginner-Level Assignment (Cloud Computing Focus):
This assignment focuses on basic cloud commands and file handling, which are commonly used when working with Linux in cloud environments.

**File Handling:

Create a directory named cloud_project using mkdir.
Inside this directory, create 5 text files named file1.txt, file2.txt, etc., using touch.
Copy file1.txt to a subdirectory named backup using the cp command.
Use cat to concatenate file2.txt and file3.txt and save the result in combined.txt.
Compress the backup directory using tar -czf.


**Permissions and Environment Variables:

Create a script that prints "Hello Cloud" and save it as greet.sh. Use chmod u+x to make it executable.
Add a custom environment variable CLOUD_USER with the value "student" using export. Display the variable using printenv.
Write a command that updates the PATH to include a custom bin directory (create this directory using mkdir ~/bin).


**Networking and Cloud Commands:

Use wget to download a file from a given URL.
Use scp to copy a file from your local machine to a remote server.
Use ssh to log in to a remote server and list all files in the /home directory.
Schedule a job using at to create a file at a specified time in the future.


**Monitoring and Processes:

Use top to monitor the CPU usage on your cloud instance.
Display the amount of available RAM using free.
Use df to check disk usage and ensure that your cloud instance has sufficient space.


**Package Management:

Install nginx using apt install (for Ubuntu) or yum install (for RedHat).
Check the status of the nginx service using systemctl status nginx.

**Advanced Problem:
Set up a cron job that runs a backup script every day at 2 AM and saves a copy of the /var/www/ directory into a compressed tar file.
